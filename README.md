## Deployment

The app is configured for **Netlify** via the Nitro `netlify` preset. All `server/api/` routes are automatically deployed as Netlify Functions.

```toml
# netlify.toml is included — no extra configuration needed
```

Push to your connected Netlify repo and it deploys automatically.

---

## Data Source

All match data is fetched from ESPN's public (unofficial) API endpoints. No API key is required. The server-side API routes in `server/api/` act as a proxy layer, normalizing the ESPN responses into clean typed shapes consumed by the frontend composables.
